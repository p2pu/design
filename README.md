This repository serves as the central place for storing design assets.

# Voice and Tone
- Smart but not stuffy. We’re informed, but accessible. A shared understanding is more important than looking smart. Avoid jargon, stiff or bloated language.
- Quirky but not offensive. Be charming. We aim to be memorable enough that you tell your friends, but not so much that it scares you away.
- Excited but not sales-y. Use your sense of excitement. Bold statements are OK. In learning new things, people will go to great lengths to avoid humiliation, so make sure you’re making people feel at ease, engaged, and occasionally delighted.
- Casual but not sloppy. A casual tone reinforces our peer learning model. We’re all at the same level–there’s no need for formality. That being said, be concise and use proper punctuation.
- Massive but not a mob. When possible, use the 2nd person plural (we) and active voice. We’re storytellers and real people–point toward the experience of community members before the theory or idea behind it.
- Participatory but not perfect. We’re inviting, and anyone can get involved who wants to. Be mindful of your references–we’re an international organization with diverse backgrounds. Too many US-centric references will not get your message across.

The **Brand book** documents the visual identity of P2PU and serves as a guide for creating new resources.

# A note on file formats for printable assets

Whenever new assets are created, the original file (source format) and a printable format are added to this repository.

**Source files** are always included in an open file format (like SVG) so modifications can be made in the future without the need for non-free software. Text are kept as SVG text and all fonts that deviate from the Brandbook are noted.

**Printable files** are saved as PDF with all fonts converted to paths.
